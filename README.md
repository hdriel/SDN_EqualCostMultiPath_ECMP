# Software Defined Networks

### Python at Linux (Ubuntu)

## Description

In this project, I have developed a network, with a networkX, matplotlib, a random network that has a number of hosts and switches, which are randomly placed according to any algorithm specified in the task.
Once a graph has been created, it is dictated and saved as an image and as a .txt file that controller reads this file and works in it, and navigates the creation of a connection in another simple random path.

* Here are screenshots of the project:
